# Cryptography & Blockchain Coursework

This repository contains my coursework and final project for classes on **cryptography**, **cryptocurrency**, and **blockchain systems**.  
All implementations are organized inside the `src/` directory, with separate folders for each assignment and project.

## Overview

The work covers a broad range of topics, including:
- Classical and modern **cryptographic algorithms**  
- **Elliptic curve methods** and advanced cryptographic constructions  
- **Blockchain fundamentals** such as Merkle trees, Bloom filters, and simple chains  
- **Smart contracts and tokens** on Ethereum  
- **Custom encryption designs**, stream ciphers, and statistical testing  
- A complete **decentralized stock market simulation** as the final project  

## Repository Structure

[Cryptographic algorithms](src/1/)

[Elliptic curve cryptography](src/2/)

[Blockchain fundamentals & Smart contracts & tokens](src/3/)

[Vanity address generation](src/bonus/)

[LFSR & randomness tests](src/cryptography/LFSR.py)

[Custom encryption algorithm](src/cryptography/godel.py)

[Advanced ECC & hashing](src/cryptography/3/)

[Cryptographic algorithms](src/final/)


Each folder may contain its own **README** with more details about that specific part.

## Final Project

The course concludes with a **decentralized stock market application** on Ethereum:
- Solidity smart contracts  
- Price feeds via **Chainlink oracles**  
- A frontend interface for user interaction  

## Technologies
- **Python** â€“ algorithm implementations  
- **Solidity, Web3, Chainlink** â€“ Ethereum development  
- **React / JavaScript** â€“ frontend
